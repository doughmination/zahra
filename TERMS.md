## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By adding Zahra to your Discord server, using any of its commands, or accessing our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use Zahra.

These Terms apply to all users, including server administrators, moderators, and end users.

## 2. Description of Service

Zahra is a free, open-source Discord bot providing moderation tools including — but not limited to — bans, kicks, warnings, mutes, case management, purging, and server information commands. Zahra is provided "as is" and is free to use under the terms of the **Estrogen Source-Available Licence (ESAL-1.3)**.

---

## 3. Eligibility

You must comply with Discord's own Terms of Service to use Zahra. You must be of the minimum age required by Discord in your region. By using Zahra, you represent that you meet these requirements.

---

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use Zahra to:

- Harass, threaten, or harm any individual or group.
- Violate any applicable laws or regulations.
- Abuse the bot to spam Discord's API or disrupt other users.
- Attempt to exploit, reverse-engineer, or attack the bot's infrastructure.
- Use the bot in a manner that violates Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

We reserve the right to block any server or user from accessing Zahra for violations of these Terms, at our sole discretion.

---

## 5. Moderation Data and Server Administrators

Server administrators who add Zahra take responsibility for how the bot is used within their server. Moderation actions (bans, kicks, warnings, etc.) are recorded and attributed to the Discord user who issued them. Zahra stores this data as described in our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md).

Administrators are responsible for ensuring their use of Zahra's moderation features complies with applicable laws (including data protection laws in their jurisdiction) and Discord's policies.

## 6. Availability and Uptime

Zahra is provided free of charge with no uptime guarantees. We aim for high availability but do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or available at any particular time. Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance may occur without notice.

## 7. Open Source and Self-Hosting

Zahra's source code is available under the ESAL-1.3 licence. Non-commercial self-hosting is permitted subject to the licence terms. For commercial use, contact us at [admin@doughmination.win](mailto:admin@doughmination.win).

Self-hosted instances are operated by their respective hosts. We are not responsible for data handling or conduct in self-hosted deployments.
